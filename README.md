## Introduction

This web application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to provide code conversion, debugging, and code quality assessment services. You can use this application to:

- Convert code from one programming language to another.
- Debug code by checking for errors and providing corrections.
- Assess the quality of code and receive improvement suggestions.

## Features

- Code conversion between different programming languages.
- Code debugging and error correction.
- Code quality assessment with improvement suggestions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local development machine.
- An OpenAI API key. You can obtain one by signing up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CodeConvertor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd code_converter
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Convert Code

To convert code from one programming language to another:

1. Make a POST request to `/convert` with the following JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "code": "your_source_code_here",
     "language": "target_language_here"
   }
   ```

2. The server will respond with the converted code.

### Debug Code

To debug code and check for errors:

1. Make a POST request to `/debug` with the following JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "prompt": "your_code_to_debug_here"
   }
   ```

2. The server will respond with debug information, error checking, and corrections if needed.

### Quality Check

To assess the quality of code and receive improvement suggestions:

1. Make a POST request to `/quality` with the following JSON payload:

   ```json
   {
     "prompt": "code_to_assess_quality_here"
   }
   ```

2. The server will respond with detailed quality assessment and improvement tips.

## API Endpoints
